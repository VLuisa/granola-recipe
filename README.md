# Granola Recipe

A little granola recipe I made for myself. I often find myself using the [Crunchy Granola Recipe by King Arthur Flour](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/crunchy-granola-recipe) but the default recipe is 2x the amount I usually want to make. After miscalculating what half is one too many times I made this quick tool to help me calculate the portion amounts I want.

As part of this I implemented a simplistic approach to creating fractions out of decimals, I played with some new HTML elements to make those fractions pretty, and added some Svelte fade transitions to clarify the parts of the recipe that are updated with each calculation.

While cooking/baking I'm always annoyed by how online recipes list amounts only as part of the ingredient list which leaves me to constantly scroll up and down while cooking. So for this I experimented with listing the amounts directly in the recipe for a more seamless baking experience.
